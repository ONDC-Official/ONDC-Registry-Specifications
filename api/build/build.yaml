               - "P" indicates the period.
               - "T" indicates the time part.
               - "30S" represents 30 seconds.
               
               So, "PT30S" signifies a duration of 30 seconds.

               - "P" indicates the period.
               - "T" indicates the time part.
               - "30S" represents 30 seconds.
               
               So, "PT30S" signifies a duration of 30 seconds.

               - "P" indicates the period.
               - "T" indicates the time part.
               - "30S" represents 30 seconds.
               
               So, "PT30S" signifies a duration of 30 seconds.

               In the case of "PT30S," it represents a duration of 30 seconds. Here's a breakdown of the components:
               
               - "P" indicates the period.
               - "T" indicates the time part.
               - "30S" represents 30 seconds.
               
               So, "PT30S" signifies a duration of 30 seconds.

      Value: '"amount", "percent- annualized", "percent"'
      Description: >-
        If set to "amount" it means Buyer App's fee is a flat amount in INR. If
        set to "percent" it means Buyer App’s fee is an absolute percentage  of
        the total loan amount

        If set to "percent- annualized" it means the Buyer App's fee is set as a
        percentage of the Total Loan Disbursed for a 12-month tenure loan.


        For example: Assume the Buyer App Fees' value is 5%


        For a 12 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to
        the Buyer App would be 5% * (12 months/ 12 months) i.e 5%


        For 6 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
        Buyer App would be 5% * (6 months/ 12 months) i.e 2.5%


        For 18 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
        Buyer App would be 5% * (18 months/ 12 months) i.e 7.5%
