    Value: '"amount", "percent- annualized", "percent"'
    Description: >-
      If set to "amount" it means Buyer App's fee is a flat amount in INR.
      If set to "percent" it means Buyer Appâ€™s fee is an absolute percentage 
      of the total loan amount

      If set to "percent- annualized" it means the Buyer App's fee is set as a
      percentage of the Total Loan Disbursed for a 12-month tenure loan.


      For example: Assume the Buyer App Fees' value is 5%


      For a 12 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (12 months/ 12 months) i.e 5%


      For 6 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (6 months/ 12 months) i.e 2.5%


      For 18 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (18 months/ 12 months) i.e 7.5%
